Experiments with Carbon/Cocoa mix

So, this should be an experiment with the older Carbon code that will have to change from 32 bit Carbon to 64 bit Cocoa.

General ide is to convert as little Carbon code to Cocoa and continue using CarbonCore for everything that is still possible in CarbonCore so it compiles on M1 and latest Xcode having the deprecations warnings off.
